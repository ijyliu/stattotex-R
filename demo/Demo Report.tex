% Demo Report.tex
% This is a minimal LaTeX document demonstrating the use of variables saved by stattotex

\documentclass{article}

% Add demoNums.tex as input
% This will add the variables as commands
\input{demoNums.tex}

\begin{document}

    This is a demonstation of the stattotex package.

    % Variables can be imported using the \ and then the name
    Import of a formatted number: \AvgMonthlySales

    Import of a percentage: \SaleIncPct

    Import of a word: \SaleDir

    % Adding \space may be helpful in correcting spacing
    Sample paragraph: Every month last quarter, we sold an average of \AvgMonthlySales \space units. This is a \SaleIncPct \space change relative to the prior quarter, meaning our revenue significantly \SaleDir.
